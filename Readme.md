Boilerplate for http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata 

## Setup
1. Clone Repo!
2. Install nodejs > v16 
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run jest:watch`
5. Code to make test pass
6. Write new requirement as a failing test
7. Refactor
8. GoTo 5

note - if you can't easily write code to make a test pass, then go backwards.
Remove the failing test, then Refactor, the add the test back.

Don't forget to refactor tests, using production code to make sure that tests are still valid.
