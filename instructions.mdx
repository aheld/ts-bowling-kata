# External API

- call roll for each roll
- calculate score at the end
- Assume good inputs (rolls always equal a full game)


    +--------------------+
    | Game               |
    | ------------------ |
    | + roll(pins : int) |
    | + score() : int    |
    +--------------------+

# Gutter Game
    
Given a standard game of bowling  
When 20 rolls are 0 (gutter ball)  
Then the score should be 0  

```typescript
test('Gutter Game (all zeros)', () => {
    for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) game.roll(0)
    expect(game.score()).toBe(0)
  })
```

---

# Passing code

```typescript
  score(): number {
    return 0
  }
```

---

# Simple games
    
Given a standard game of bowling  
When 20 rolls are 1  
Then the score should be 20  

```typescript
for (i; i < 20; i ++) {
    game.roll(1);
}
game.score().should.equal(20);
```

---

# Passing code

```typescript
  roll(roll: number) {
    total += roll
  }

  score(): number {
    return total
  }
```

---

# Refactor Tests

## Always be stable!

Use *Working Code* as tests for test code

- Condense ``for`` loops into ``rollMany``
- Does this belong in Production code OR Test code?
```typescript
    game.rollMany(20, 0) //roll 20 zeros
    rollMany(game, 20, 0) //roll 20 zeros
```

---

# Sum games

```cucumber
Given a standard game of bowling  
When all roll are less than 5  
When I roll a <rollA> 10 times
When I roll a <rollB> 10 times
Then the score is the sum of the rolls <score>

Examples:
| rollA | rollB | score |
| 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 3     | 4     | 70    |
| 4     | 5     | 90    |
```

---

# Game with a single spare

if we roll a 5 three times, and then all zeros the score should be 20

- roll '5' 3 times
- roll '0' 17 times
    - Score should be 20

You may need to remove this test, refactor, then procede

# Game with a single strike

if we roll a Strike , then a 3 two times, and then all zeros the score should be 16

- roll '10' one time
- roll '3' two times
- roll '0' 16 times
    - Score should be 22

---

# Game with mixed strikes and spares

Rolls:
3,4,6,4,7,1,4,5,10,4,6,10,10,10,5,5,3 = 169

---

# New Requirement!

## Bad input!
- Throw an exception if score is called and you don't have a complete game

---

# New Requirement!

## Per frame scoring

- be able to call score at any time and return the current score
- return known score if current frame cannot be scored

---

# New Requirement!

## Kids bowling

- GutterBalls are not allowed
- All rolls of 0 are re-rolled
- Kid bolwing will be indicated by the caller (constructor arg?)
 
---

# New Requirement!

## Drunk bowling

- Any 4 consecutive rolls of zero is considered a drunk player
- Drunk players have thier score tallied immediately and game ends
 
---

# New Requirement!

## Klingon Bowling

- Each frame gets 3 rolls
- the lowest roll is considered ghojwI' (“student”) and is not counted
- two consective 0 rolls earns bIj (“punishment”) of -10

Klingons do not deliver software  
They execute requirements  

---

# Temporial Bowling

- Check the time when you start a game
- if the time is < Noon, then score according to kids bowling 
- if the time is > 10pm, then score according to the drunk bowling 
- if the time is a pallendrome, then score according to klingon bowling
